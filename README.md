**Welcome to Kodex!**

**Kodex** is currently a partially open-source project that will become fully open-sourced and decentralized when the time is right. 

We are in the MVP (Minimum Viable Product) stage, which remains centralized and is primarily designed for prototyping and initial market testing. We are gradually transitioning to a decentralized model while actively gathering feedback from our customers.

Feel free to explore our documentation and explainer videos for more details:   <br>
